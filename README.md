## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a DevOps Engineer with 8+ years of experience across system engineering, cloud infrastructure, and DevOps automation.  
Currently based in the UK, I work on cloud migration and automation projects that improve reliability, reduce operational overhead, and support scalable digital platforms.

I specialise in designing and operating cloud-native systems using Infrastructure as Code, CI/CD pipelines, and container orchestration.  
I am particularly interested in how **cloud, DevOps, and AI** can lower barriers for businesses and enable global-scale innovation.
